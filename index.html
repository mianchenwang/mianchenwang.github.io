        <p>
            I am a fashion, artist’s book and communication designer with a unique
design perspective. I was born and raised in Beijing, because I grew up in a
fast-developing city, I am constantly exploring and always curious about things
happen around me. Recently, I’m studying at Parsons the New School for
Design completing my senior year of study. Thought my stay in New York, I
have been working for several fashion companies including Anne Bowen,
Babyghost NYC, Tibi, Zac Posen and Theory. The style of my fashion work
focuses on functionality and street-style with a sense of chicness; and as a
book artist I pay more attention on the content and readers’ personal
interaction with my work. My main design inspirations come from the book,
movie, artwork and social phenomena that I observe. I usually design
regardless of gender, in order to make my wearer feel comfortable in my work,
and stay free to express their extraordinary personalities. My biggest strength
is to combine my vision of fashion and communication together, in this way I
can think in both visual and logical ways when I’m doing my work. My wish is
to combine my knowledge, perspective, and experience that I obtained from
the two fields to deliver the best creativity to my clients and audiences.
